Jido has been under active development for the past few months. Most of that work has been foundational, focused on building a solid framework that makes it easy to build complex AI agents in Elixir.

Today, I'm excited to finally share a "real" example of what can be done with Jido. There's a lot more to come, but this will give you a taste of what's possible.

### The Weather Agent

We're going to build a simple agent that can answer natural language questions about the weather. It will understand the request, use a tool to fetch weather data, and then provide a response, all orchestrated by Jido and an LLM.

You can run the complete, interactive example in Livebook right now:

[![Run in Livebook](https://livebook.dev/badge/v1/blue.svg)](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fagentjido%2Fjido_workbench%2Fmain%2Fpriv%2Fdocumentation%2Fcookbook%2Fweather-tool-response.livemd)

### The Code

Let's break down the components involved in building this agent.

#### 1. The Weather Tool (Action)

The first component is the `Jido.Tools.Weather` Action. This Action uses the [`weather`](https://hex.pm/packages/weather) package from [@spencerolson](https://hex.pm/users/spencerolson) to get the weather for a given location. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data. For demonstration purposes in the Livebook, we default to using test data (`test: true`) so you don't need an API key immediately.

```elixir
# Definition from jido_tools/lib/jido_tools/weather.ex
defmodule Jido.Tools.Weather do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "weather",
    description: "Get the weather for a given location via the OpenWeatherMap API",
    category: "Weather",
    tags: ["weather"],
    vsn: "1.0.0",
    schema: [
      location: [type: :string, doc: "The location to get the weather for"],
      units: [type: :string, doc: "Units to use (metric/imperial)", default: "metric"],
      hours: [type: :integer, doc: "Number of hours to forecast", default: 24],
      format: [type: :string, doc: "Output format (text/map)", default: "text"],
      test: [type: :boolean, doc: "Whether to use test data instead of real API", default: true]
    ]

  def run(params, _context) do
    # ... logic to fetch weather data (real or test) ...
    # ... format the response ...
    with {:ok, opts} <- build_opts(params),
         {:ok, response} <- Weather.API.fetch_weather(opts) do
      {:ok, format_response(response.body, params)}
    else
      {:error, error} -> {:error, "Failed to fetch weather: #{inspect(error)}"}
    end
  end

  # Private functions to build options and format response...
end
```

The full code for the Weather Action is available [here](https://github.com/agentjido/jido_tools/blob/main/lib/jido_tools/weather.ex).

Actions are the fundamental building blocks in Jido. They encapsulate a single, reusable piece of functionality. By using `use Jido.Action`, we get:

- **Schema Validation:** The `schema` defines the expected input parameters, their types, and documentation. Jido validates incoming parameters against this schema automatically.
- **Metadata:** `name`, `description`, `category`, etc., provide context for humans and potentially for AI agents to understand what the Action does.
- **Standard Interface:** The `run/2` function is the entry point for executing the Action's logic.
- **Tool Conversion:** Crucially, `Jido.Action` includes functionality (like `to_tool/0`) that converts the Action's definition into a format compatible with LLM frameworks like Langchain, including generating a JSON schema for the parameters. This allows the LLM to understand how to call the Action.

You can learn more about Actions in the [Actions & Workflows guide](https://hexdocs.pm/jido/guides/actions/actions.html).

#### 2. The Weather Agent Module

Next, we define the agent itself. This module brings together the configuration and provides the user-facing interface.

```elixir
defmodule WeatherAgent do
  use Jido.Agent, name: "weather_agent"

  # Start the underlying Jido AI Agent server
  def start_link(_opts \\ []) do
    Jido.AI.Agent.start_link(
      agent: __MODULE__,           # Link this module to the server
      # log_level: :info,         # Optional: Increase agent logging
      ai: [                       # AI-specific configuration
        model: {:openai, model: "gpt-4o-mini"}, # Specify the LLM
        prompt: """
        You are an enthusiastic weather reporter.
        <%= @message %>
        """,                     # Define the agent's persona and base prompt
        tools: [
          Jido.Tools.Weather      # Make our Weather Action available as a tool
        ],
        # verbose: true           # Optional: Enable verbose Langchain logging
      ]
    )
  end

  # Delegate specific calls to the underlying Jido.AI.Agent
  defdelegate chat_response(pid, message), to: Jido.AI.Agent
  defdelegate tool_response(pid, message), to: Jido.AI.Agent
end

# Start the Weather Agent process
{:ok, pid} = WeatherAgent.start_link()
```

This module uses `Jido.Agent`, marking it as a Jido agent process. The key part is `Jido.AI.Agent.start_link/1`. This starts the specialized `Jido.AI.Agent`, provided by the `jido_ai` package, pre-configured with AI capabilities. We pass it:

- `agent: __MODULE__`: Links this definition to the running process.
- `ai: [...]`: A keyword list containing configuration for the AI behavior:
  - `model`: Specifies which LLM to use (via `Jido.AI.Model` abstraction). Here, we use OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini.
  - `prompt`: A base prompt defining the agent's persona. The `<%= @message %>` is an EEx template snippet where the user's actual query will be injected.
  - `tools`: A list of `Jido.Action` modules that the agent is allowed to use. This is where we connect our `Jido.Tools.Weather` Action.

We also `delegate` the `tool_response/2` function to `Jido.AI.Agent`, providing a clean API for interacting with our specific `WeatherAgent`.

#### 3. The Jido AI Agent & Skill (`jido_ai`)

The `Jido.AI.Agent` module provides the core implementation for AI-powered agents. It builds upon the standard `Jido.Agent` and integrates the `Jido.AI.Skill`.

```elixir
# Simplified from jido_ai/lib/jido_ai/agent.ex
defmodule Jido.AI.Agent do
  use Jido.Agent, name: "jido_ai_agent"
  # ...

  @default_opts [
    skills: [Jido.AI.Skill], # Default skill providing AI capabilities
    agent: __MODULE__
  ]

  def start_link(opts) do
    opts = Keyword.merge(@default_opts, opts)
    # Starts the GenServer with merged config (including model, prompt, tools passed in)
    Jido.Agent.Server.start_link(opts)
  end

  # Function called by our WeatherAgent.tool_response
  def tool_response(pid, message) do
    # Build a Jido Signal representing the request
    {:ok, signal} = build_signal("jido.ai.tool.response", message)
    # Send the signal to the agent process (synchronous call)
    call(pid, signal)
  end

  defp build_signal(type, message) do
    Jido.Signal.new(%{ type: type, data: %{message: message} })
  end
  # ...
end
```

When `WeatherAgent.tool_response/2` is called, it delegates to `Jido.AI.Agent.tool_response/2`. This function wraps the user's message into a `Jido.Signal` with the type `"jido.ai.tool.response"` and sends it to the agent process using `Jido.Agent.call/2`.

Signals are the standard messaging format within Jido. The agent process receives this signal, and this is where the `Jido.AI.Skill` comes in.

```elixir
# Simplified from jido_ai/lib/jido_ai/skill.ex
defmodule Jido.AI.Skill do
  use Jido.Skill, name: "jido_ai_skill"
  # ... defines opts_schema for :model, :prompt, :tools etc.

  # Defines how signal types map to Actions
  def router(_opts \\ []) do
    [
      {"jido.ai.chat.response", %Instruction{action: Jido.AI.Actions.Instructor.ChatResponse}},
      {"jido.ai.tool.response", %Instruction{action: Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.ToolResponse}} # <- Our match!
    ]
  end

  # Pre-processes the signal before the Action runs
  def handle_signal(%Signal{type: "jido.ai.tool.response"} = signal, skill_opts) do
    # Extracts model, prompt, tools from skill_opts (originally from start_link)
    # Renders the user message into the base prompt template
    # Bundles everything into parameters for the ToolResponse Action
    base_prompt = Keyword.get(skill_opts, :prompt)
    rendered_prompt = render_prompt(base_prompt, signal.data) # Injects message
    tools = Keyword.get(skill_opts, :tools, [])
    model = Keyword.get(skill_opts, :model)
    # ...
    tool_response_params = %{ model: model, prompt: rendered_prompt, tools: tools, ... }

    # Update the signal's data payload with the prepared params
    {:ok, %{signal | data: tool_response_params}}
  end
  # ...
end
```

The `Jido.AI.Skill` is configured by default in `Jido.AI.Agent`. Its `router/1` function maps the incoming signal type `"jido.ai.tool.response"` to an `Instruction` to execute the `Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.ToolResponse` Action.

Before the action runs, the skill's `handle_signal/2` callback intercepts the signal. It takes the configuration passed during `start_link` (like the model, base prompt, and list of tools) and the incoming message from the signal data. It renders the user's message into the EEx prompt template and packages everything neatly as parameters for the next step: the `ToolResponse` Action.

#### 4. The Tool Response Action (`jido_ai`)

This is where the core LLM interaction happens, coordinated by Langchain.

```elixir
# Simplified from jido_ai/lib/jido_ai/actions/langchain/tool_response.ex
defmodule Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.ToolResponse do
  use Jido.Action, name: "generate_tool_response"
  # ... schema defines :model, :prompt, :tools, etc.

  alias Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain, as: LangchainAction # The lower-level Langchain action

  def run(params, _context) do
    # Params received from Jido.AI.Skill.handle_signal
    # (contains rendered prompt, model, list of tool Actions)

    # Prepare parameters for the underlying Langchain action
    completion_params = %{
      model: params.model,
      prompt: params.prompt, # Already rendered with user message
      tools: params.tools,   # List of Jido.Action modules [Jido.Tools.Weather]
      temperature: params.temperature || 0.7,
      verbose: params.verbose || false
    }

    # Delegate to the lower-level Langchain action
    case LangchainAction.run(completion_params, %{}) do
      {:ok, %{content: content, tool_results: tool_results}} ->
        # If successful, return the final content and any tool results
        {:ok, %{ result: content, tool_results: tool_results }}

      {:error, reason} ->
        # Handle errors from the Langchain interaction
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
end
```

This action receives the prepared parameters from the `Jido.AI.Skill`. Its main job is to:

1.  Package the `model`, the final `prompt` (with the user message injected), and the list of available `tools` (`[Jido.Tools.Weather]`).
2.  Call the underlying `Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.run/2` function. This lower-level action handles the actual communication with the LLM via the `langchain` hex package.
3.  Crucially, `Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain` takes the list of Jido `tools`, converts them into the format the LLM expects (using `YourAction.to_tool()`), and enables Langchain's function/tool-calling mechanism.
4.  The LLM receives the prompt and the descriptions of the available tools. It decides _if_ a tool is needed. If yes (like in our weather query), it determines _which_ tool (`weather`) and _what parameters_ to use (e.g., `%{location: "Tokyo"}`).
5.  Langchain receives this decision back from the LLM. It then finds the corresponding Jido Action (`Jido.Tools.Weather`) and executes its `run/2` function with the parameters provided by the LLM (`%{location: "Tokyo"}`).
6.  The result from `Jido.Tools.Weather.run/2` (the weather data) is sent back to the LLM.
7.  The LLM uses this result, combined with the original prompt ("You are an enthusiastic weather reporter..."), to generate the final, user-friendly text response.
8.  This final text response (`content`) is returned by `LangchainAction.run/2` and then by `ToolResponse.run/2`.

### Pulling It All Together

So, when you call `WeatherAgent.tool_response(pid, "What is the weather like in Tokyo right now?")`:

1.  **`WeatherAgent` -> `Jido.AI.Agent`**: The call delegates, creating a `Signal` type `"jido.ai.tool.response"` with the message.
2.  **`Jido.Agent.Server`**: Receives the signal.
3.  **`Jido.AI.Skill`**: The router maps the signal type to `Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.ToolResponse`. `handle_signal` prepares the parameters (rendered prompt, model, tools).
4.  **`Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain.ToolResponse`**: Executes its `run` function with the prepared params.
5.  **`Jido.AI.Actions.Langchain`**: Called by `ToolResponse`. It talks to the LLM (GPT-4o Mini), providing the prompt and the `Jido.Tools.Weather` tool definition.
6.  **LLM Decision**: The LLM decides to call the `weather` tool with `location: "Tokyo"`.
7.  **Langchain Execution**: Langchain triggers `Jido.Tools.Weather.run(%{location: "Tokyo"}, _context)`.
8.  **`Jido.Tools.Weather`**: Fetches (test) weather data and returns it.
9.  **LLM Formatting**: The weather data goes back to the LLM.
10. **Final Response**: The LLM generates the enthusiastic weather report based on the data and the initial prompt.
11. **Return**: The final text bubbles back up through the actions, skill, and agent server to the original caller.

The power here is how Jido components (Agents, Skills, Actions) and `jido_ai` provide the structure and orchestration, letting Langchain and the LLM handle the complex natural language understanding and tool coordination.

### Agent Showcase

Let's see it handle a few more questions, just like in the Livebook:

```elixir
# Ask about tomorrow's weather
WeatherAgent.tool_response(pid, "Will I need an umbrella in Paris tomorrow?")
```

```elixir
# Ask about multiple locations
WeatherAgent.tool_response(pid, "Compare the weather in New York and San Francisco today.")
```

```elixir
# Ask a more complex weather question
WeatherAgent.tool_response(pid, "Is it a good day for hiking in the mountains near Seattle?")
```

### Conclusion

This Weather Agent example, while simple, demonstrates the core concepts of building AI-powered agents with Jido and `jido_ai`. By composing Actions (like `Jido.Tools.Weather`) and leveraging the pre-built `Jido.AI.Agent` and `Jido.AI.Skill`, we can quickly create agents that understand natural language, use tools to interact with the world (or APIs), and respond intelligently.

The separation of concerns – Actions for specific tasks, Skills for capability management, and Agents for state and process lifecycle – makes the system modular and extensible.

There's much more to explore in Jido, including state management, complex workflows, signal routing, and more. Check out the resources below to learn more!
